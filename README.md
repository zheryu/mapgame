# MapGame
A web based version of the Map Game, a collaborative, DnD meets Civ mashup RP game.

## What is the Map Game?
Map Game is a DnD-esque game where players take control of nations or organizations in fictional worlds, conducting diplomacy, war, and history-building. Traditionally, it was played with google spreadsheets and facebook groups.

## Purpose
Map games started simple, with few features other than a map and some city locations. In game actions were usually initiated by players and then mediated by the map god. Lately, these games have started featuring more and more player resource tracking. Now, there are so many variables to track that the mapgods—our DMs—are spending more time updating spreadsheets than writing the story! Moving to a web-based platform will mean that we can set up and run our games with less hassle and spend more time on the lore of our stories—the fun stuff.
