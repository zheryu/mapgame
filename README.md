# mapgame
A web based version of the Map Game, a collaborative, DnD meets Civ mashup RP game.

## What is the Map Game?
Map Game is a DnD-esque game where players take control of nations or organizations in fictional worlds, conducting diplomacy, war, and history-building. Traditionally, it was played with google spreadsheets and facebook groups.

## What is this repo about?
Initially, these games started simple, but lately they have been growing more and more complex. Now, there are so many variables that the mapgods-- our DMs--are spending more time updating spreadsheets than writing the story! Moving to a web-based platform will mean that we can set up and run our games with less hassle and spend more time on the lore of our stories.
